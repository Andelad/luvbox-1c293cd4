# Developers Handbook Guidance

## Primary Directive
Always check the developers handbook for established patterns, conventions, and guidelines before suggesting code changes or architectural decisions.

**ðŸ“– Developers Handbook Location: `/docs/developers-handbook.md`**

## Handbook Maintenance Responsibilities

### 1. Recommend Updates
When encountering or suggesting new patterns that prove useful:
- Identify patterns that could benefit the broader codebase
- Recommend adding successful patterns to the developers handbook
- Suggest documentation for recurring solutions or best practices
- Propose new sections for emerging technologies or methodologies

### 2. Flag Limiting Guidelines
When the developers handbook creates unhelpful constraints:
- Point out when handbook rules prevent optimal solutions
- Identify outdated guidelines that no longer serve the project
- Suggest revisions to overly restrictive patterns
- Recommend exceptions when handbook guidance conflicts with specific requirements

### 3. Handbook Integration
- Reference specific handbook sections when making recommendations
- Explain how suggested code aligns with or deviates from handbook guidance
- Propose handbook updates alongside code suggestions when appropriate
- Ensure consistency between new code and documented patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Always consider handbook guidance as a starting point, not an absolute constraint
- Balance adherence to established patterns with project-specific needs
- Proactively suggest handbook improvements to keep documentation current and valuable
