# Sidebar Toggle Fix

## Issue
When clicking the sidebar toggle button, the main content area would disappear and the sidebar would also disappear, causing a JavaScript error.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect content references in the `SidebarNavigation.tsx` file. The code was trying to access `CONTENT.CONTENT.navigation.theBox` and `CONTENT.CONTENT.navigation.theMap` instead of the correct `CONTENT.navigation.theBox` and `CONTENT.navigation.theMap`.

This double `CONTENT` reference caused a JavaScript error: 
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'navigation')
```

When the sidebar tried to render with expanded text, it would crash and disappear, and this error would cascade to make the main content area also disappear.

## Solution
Fixed the incorrect content references in `/src/app/components/SidebarNavigation.tsx`:

**Before (broken):**
```tsx
<p>{CONTENT.CONTENT.navigation.theBox}</p>
<p>{CONTENT.CONTENT.navigation.theMap}</p>
```

**After (fixed):**
```tsx
<p>{CONTENT.navigation.theBox}</p>
<p>{CONTENT.navigation.theMap}</p>
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/components/SidebarNavigation.tsx` - Fixed double CONTENT references

## Testing
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ Dev server runs without errors
- ✅ No JavaScript console errors
- ✅ Sidebar toggle functionality works as expected
- ✅ Content remains visible when sidebar is expanded/collapsed

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. No JavaScript errors when toggling the sidebar
2. Sidebar renders properly in both collapsed and expanded states
3. Content remains visible during sidebar state changes
4. Sidebar navigation text displays correctly
5. Smooth transitions between sidebar states work as intended
